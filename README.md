# Malicious-Url-Detection

Three Machine learning models are applied with the URL into 22 lexical filters for detecting 
whether the URL is malware or safe.

Phishing, malware, benign, and defacement URL detection are achieved using machine learning
models: Random Forest, LightGBM and XGBoost, along with features extracted from URLs.
